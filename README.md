# Python-Video-Game
A game I made in spare time for fun. Created using the Pygame Library. Combines characters from the game Minecraft and the way of playing from the game Slay the Spire. 

Important points before running the game:
- Everything is downloaded and stored in the same folder.
- The Pygame Library is installed.
- Run the file main.py to run the game.
